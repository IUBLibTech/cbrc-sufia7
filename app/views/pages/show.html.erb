<p>The Center for Biological Research Collections (CBRC) is a consortium of research-based scientific collections at Indiana University. The CBRC is funded by the College of Arts and Sciences,
  the Office for the Vice President for Research, the Department of Biology, the Department of Anthropology, and the Department of Geological Sciences.</p>
<p>The CBRC enhances collection-based research and education in biodiversity, zooarchaeology, paleontology, and related disciplines by providing shared infrastructural and data management
  support for IUâ€™s biological research collections. The Center focuses on collections of biological specimens, including fossils and archaeological remains that have shared taxonomic,
  geographic, and temporal metadata requirements.</p>
<p>This repository was developed by the Indiana University Libraries, in conjunction with the CBRC, to provide an archive for the digital assets generated in the Indiana University Herbarium,
  the Indiana University Paleontology Collection, and the William R. Adams Zooarchaeology Laboratory.</p>
